# Unit Testing Codeing Guidline 

### Intro
Unit testing is a critical component to the success of the project.  Unit testing keeps
the framework maintainable and less prone to bugs and unforeseen exceptions. To simplify
the process of writing a unit test we at MCS has introduced a set of rules. Making it easy
for us all involved to read and examine the test and if needed adjust a test to make it 
more reliable.

### Comments
A developer committing code must only apply comments if necessary.  Mainly because comments
might become outdated, confusing other developers trying to improve an already exisitng test. 
To combat comments please choose good variable, method and class names instead of adding 
comments.
